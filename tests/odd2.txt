I'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel
I'm gonna drive you through the night down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where it's dumped but have no fear

There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
There's something inside you, boy
And you're still the same
